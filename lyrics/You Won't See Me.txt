When I call you up, your line's engaged
I have had enough, so act your age
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind
If you won't see me, (you won't see me)
You won't see me, (you won't see me)
I don't know why you, (oh, la la la)
Should want to hide, (oh, la la la)
But I can't get through, (oh, la la la)
My hands are tied, (oh, la la la)
I won't want to stay, (oh, la la la)
I don't have much to say, (oh, la la la)
But I get turned away, (oh, la la la)
And you won't see me, (you won't see me)
You won't see me, (you won't see me)
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing, (no, I wouldn't, no, I wouldn't)
Though the days are few, (oh, la la la)
They're filled with tears, (oh, la la la)
And since I lost you, (oh, la la la)
It feels like years, (oh, la la la)
Yes, it seems so long, (oh, la la la)
Girl, since you've been gone, (oh, la la la)
And I just can't go on, (oh, la la la)
If you won't see me, (you won't see me)
You won't see me, (you won't see me)
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing, (no, I wouldn't, no, I wouldn't)
Though the days are few, (oh, la la la)
They're filled with tears, (oh, la la la)
And since I lost you, (oh, la la la)
It feels like years, (oh, la la la)
Yes, it seems so long, (oh, la la la)
Girl, since you've been gone, (oh, la la la)
And I just can't go on, (oh, la la la)
If you won't see me, (you won't see me)
You won't see me, (you won't see me)
Yeah, oh, la la la, yeah, yeah
Oh, la la la, oh, la la la
