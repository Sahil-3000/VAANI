Yeah, yeah, sick
(d.a. got that dope)
They say these bars are like COVID (bars are like COVID, what?)
You get 'em right off the bat (you get 'em right off the bat, yeah)
Infected with SARS and Corona (infected with SARS and Corona)
Like you took a bite off of that (you took a bite off of that, damn)
And it goes from martian to human (from martian to human, yeah)
That's how the virus attacks (that's how the virus attacks)
They come at me with machine guns (at me with machine guns, brr)
Like trying to fight off a gnat
Still stackin' my chips, hoes
Higher than Shaq on his tiptoes
Atop the Empire State Buildin'
This shit is like child's play, childrеn
I will anni-nihilate, kill them
I'll fuck around and pile еight million
Dead little juveniles, wait, chill, then
I'll await my trial date 'til then (what?)
Ain't nothin' you say could ever trump (nah), mic, pencil get killed (yeah)
If you're hypersensitive, I wasn't referencin' the vice president, chill (chill)
I mean my penmanship at times tends to get ill, violence but with skill
That's why I hence when I write ends up
With the mic and pencil gettin' killed (haha, yeah, hold up)
And I'm still ride or die for the squad (yeah)
So you know which side that I'm on
If a battle line's ever drawn, but if I get involved
It'll be like K9's in a brawl
But not similar to Mike Vick at all
'Cause even if I don't have a dog in the fight
They ain't never gonna get rid of the fight in the dog (fight in the dog)
Got stripes like a tiger, so you might get mauled, a mic in the palms
Like claws, I can swing right for your jaw
And rip it off with one swipe of the paw
Bitch, you still on my dick or nah? (Nah)
If I suck, your wife is a straw (straw)
I'm sick and I'm not gonna cover my mouth next time that I cough 'cause
They say these bars are like COVID (bars are like COVID, what?)
You get 'em right off the bat (you get 'em right off the bat, yeah)
Infected with SARS and Corona (infected with SARS and Corona)
Like you took a bite off of that (you took a bite off of that, damn)
And it goes from martian to human (from martian to human, yeah)
That's how the virus attacks (that's how the virus attacks)
They come at me with machine guns (at me with machine guns, brr)
Like trying to fight off a gnat
And d.a. got that dope he sends to me (uh-huh)
It's like pneumonia symptoms and contracting COVID instantly
Which is what separates my flow from theirs
So that no one gets even close to this to pose a risk to me
So vocalistically (what?), that's social distancing (yeah)
Flow going viral, you best stay strapped
With that Lysol and get way back (shh)
Get that Pine-Sol and that Ajax
'Cause this dry cough is just like football umpires callin' a playback
Bitch, back the fuck up like 15 yards
These rhymes call for a face mask (face mask)
'Nother 14-day quarantine, they're cordoning off everything
This shit lookin' like a horror scene, like me metaphorically (damn)
'Cause them stay-at-home orders seem
Like they just keep getting more extreme
Who knows when this night-Marilyn
Like Monroe, Norma Jean (Norma Jean)
Still got that heroin lyrical drip with that morphine and that Thorazine
'Cause I'm so fuckin' dope (dope) and you're a fiend
And that's the one thing that hasn't changed (nope)
For some semblance of normalcy
But I might need that Hydrochloroquine 'cause I got that (yeah)
The Dark Horse, I'm a knight-mare
Mom fed me Valium like air (mmm)
Thought that's why they called it a high chair (whoa)
I got a contact like eyewear (whoa)
Wait a minute, bitch, let me lie here (uh)
Every year, you drop the ball like Times Square
My hair trigger whenever I get an idea's
Like, fuck, now my name rings out like a sponge mop
And my drip was a drop
In the bucket, so that gun shot
You just heard just now in that one spot
Just came from the nine mil' that I just got
That's big bucks and I got a full money clip and I'm loaded
I ain't even mean to go the fuck off
And I'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate
Groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy
I'm hoping a little codeine'll get me OD'in'
Whoa, everything is slow, I begin to floating
I know that I'm getting loaded, the pen exploded
Hiroshima with the flows, a utopia
With the dope, I'm an OG, I'm like the G.O.A.T.
Here to get your goat little bit of sodium, it's assault
When I'm at the podium, at your throat, holy camoly
I'm in the zone with the shit I'm on
Get Imodium and a commode because nobody's even close
You're petroleum to plutonium, you're a phony
I'm at the crib with your ho
Got her at the pole like voting with no clothing
Stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating
I've got my nose in the air like a Boeing
Then I got into a little bit of an argument with her
So I took a little lick of a Klonopin at dinner
Then I hit her with the motherfucking ottoman and bit her
Then I shot her in the liver, delivered her to the bottom of the river (dope)
But I'm probably gon' jump in the water with her
With a wad of money 'cause I got a lot of it
And when it come to drippin', I be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour
Never runnin' out of either one of 'em, I gotta get it 'cause
They say these bars are like COVID (bars are like COVID, what?)
You get 'em right off the bat (you get 'em right off the bat, yeah)
Infected with SARS and Corona (infected with SARS and Corona)
Like you took a bite off of that (you took a bite off of that, damn)
And it goes from martian to human (from martian to human, yeah)
That's how the virus attacks (that's how the virus attacks)
They come at me with machine guns (at me with machine guns, brr)
Like trying to fight off a gnat
